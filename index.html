            <p>
                I’m a graduate Computer Science student at Northeastern University, Boston. I’m interested in working
                with
                Software Engineering, Testing methodologies, validation and verification and the use of LLMs in the
                software
                development lifecycle
                Projects</p>

            <p>
                A code smell is defined as an anti-pattern when writing code. Presence of code smells can make code
                harder to read,
                more difficult to maintain and generally harder to debug or make changes to. The increasing usage of
                LLMs in the
                field of Software Engineering lead us to examine the effectiveness of popular LLMs in identifying these
                code smells
                and developing a tool that can help evaluate the effectiveness of these LLMs and provide the user
                feedback about
                their code.
